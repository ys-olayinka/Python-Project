# 🧠 Yusuf Olayinka – Data Engineering Portfolio (Python Projects)

Welcome to my data engineering portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of Python-based projects that highlight my experience with data pipelines, cleaning, transformation, and automation—core skills for any modern Data Engineer.

## 🔧 What You’ll Find

This repo contains three main Python projects that demonstrate practical data engineering concepts:

### 📁 1. Project.py
**Goal:** Build a basic ETL pipeline  
**Key Features:**
- Extracts data from a CSV source
- Cleans and transforms the dataset using pandas
- Loads the clean data into a structured format (e.g., JSON or DataFrame)
- Includes logging and exception handling for reliability

### 📁 2. project2.py
**Goal:** Automate data processing with scheduling  
**Key Features:**
- Uses `schedule` or `cron` to automate script execution
- Integrates with local or remote file systems
- Cleans and reformats incoming data files
- Stores processed files for downstream use

### 📁 3. project3.py
**Goal:** Simulate a mini data pipeline with API integration  
**Key Features:**
- Fetches live or mock data from a public API
- Cleans and filters JSON responses
- Converts API data to a structured DataFrame
- Saves output as CSV or loads into a database-friendly format

## 📌 Skills Demonstrated
- Python (Pandas, Requests, OS, Logging)
- ETL/ELT Pipelines
- Data Cleaning & Transformation
- API Integration
- Task Automation & Scheduling
- Error Handling & Logging
